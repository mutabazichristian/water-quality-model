Enhanced the water potability prediction model with **Batch Normalization**, **L2 Regularization**, and the **Adam optimizer** for better stability and performance. Applied **Early Stopping** to prevent overfitting and used **StandardScaler** for feature scaling. The dataset was split into **train (70%)**, **validation (15%)**, and **test (15%)** sets, with performance evaluated using a **classification report** and accuracy/loss plots. ðŸš€
